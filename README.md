# Zootopia API Animal Info Website

Welcome to my **Zootopia Animal Info** project! Welcome to my **Zootopia Animal Info** project! 🦁🐼🐢🐒🐨🐘🐍🐠...🦄

This project might look like a breeze to use (it really is!), but behind the scenes, it took some serious sweat, keyboard pounding, and lots of cursing to bring it to life. 

## Installation
To install this project, simply clone the repository and install the dependencies in requirements.txt using `pip`
"Pro" Tip: Don’t make my rookie mistake – keep your API key hidden right from the start! Create an .env file in the project’s main folder and add:
API_KEY="your_secret_api_key"

Trust me, you don’t want that heart-stopping email from GitGuardian warning you that you need to fix a secret leak!

## Usage
To run this project, type: python animals_web_generator.py. 
Then type in an animal name – any animal! – and watch what happens. 🌟
Check out the generated animals.html file and see your chosen animal's profile come to life! Open it in your browser to be amazed or not so much - but hey that was all me and my little 🧠 could do for now. There is always room for improvement, right? And if you feel like it, go for it!

## Contributing
I'm sure you can add some magic and sparkle ✨ here and contributions are welcome!
Fork it up 🍴, make a branch for your creative changes, submit a pull request with your improvements, fixes, fun ideas... I think you know how to do it. Happy coding, happy exploring, and may all your API calls be successful! 🚀
